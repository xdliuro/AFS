PyAFS: an source toolkit of Axiomatic Fuzzy Sets theory


Axiomatic Fuzzy Sets (AFS) theory facilitates a significant step on how to convert the information in the observed data into fuzzy sets (membership functions) and implement their fuzzy logic operations, which offers a far more flexible and powerful tool for representing human knowledge and emulating the human recognition process. AFS theory has gained increasing interest from various research fields recently. AFS has been extended for formal concept analysis, rough set, clustering, classification and other learning tasks. These newly proposed methods significantly boom the application of AFS theory. Due to its unique characteristic in semantic representation, AFS theory has been applied in many domains, such as business intelligence, computer vision, financial analysis, and clinical data analysis.


The codes of the AFS theory are implemented by using python.

Requirements:

	Python version 3.6 or later

	scipy  > = 0.19.1

	matplotlib > = 2.0.2
